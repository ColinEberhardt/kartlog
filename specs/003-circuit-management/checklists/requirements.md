# Specification Quality Checklist: Circuit Management

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-11-18  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - Constitution Check section is architectural guidance only
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - Resolved: circuit deletion blocked when sessions reference it
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - Specification is complete and ready for planning phase

**Validation Date**: 2025-11-18

**Clarifications Resolved**:
1. Circuit deletion behavior when referenced by sessions → Option A selected: Block deletion and display error with session count

**Next Steps**: Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` (if stakeholder review needed) or `/speckit.plan` (to create implementation plan)
